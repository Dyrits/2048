### Description (from [CodeGym | Game Tasks ~ 2048](https://codegym.cc/projects/games/com.codegym.games.game2048))
Once upon a time there lived a young Italian named Gabriele Cirulli. He was a student of programming. One day, while doing a coding exercise, he made a breakthrough in the gaming industry entirely by accident. How did he manage to do that? To complete the exercise, he chose to write a game with something similar to an existing puzzle game called "Threes".

Gabriele, who named the game "2048", spent two days on its implementation. The game was free and staggeringly successful! Even if you haven't played 2048 yourself, your friends and acquaintances most likely have. Or you've seen people playing it on public transport. Remember those colorful numbered tiles that filled smartphone screens several years back? That's 2048!

The game's name isn't random. 2048 is 2 raised to the 11th power. In the game, everything is based on powers of two.

The rules are short and sweet: you have a 4x4 board divided into square tiles. A tile with a value of 2 (probability of 90%) or 4 (probability of 10%) appears in each round. All the tiles can be moved to one of the four sides. If two tiles with the same value "collide", they merge and the tile value doubles. The objective is to get a tile whose value is 2048. The player loses if another move is no longer possible.

What's so special about the game? First of all, it's very easy to play in a browser or on a smartphone. Let's create our own version of the game right on CodeGym. Who knows? Maybe after doing this you will also accidentally
